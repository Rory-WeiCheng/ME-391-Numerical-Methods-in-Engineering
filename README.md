# ME-391 Numerical Methods in Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains the course material of **ME-391 Numerical Methods in Engineering** (formerly called **MATLAB and its applications in Engineering**), 2021 Spring @ SJTU, taught by [Prof Ye Ding](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/dingye.html). The contents include lecture slides, assignments, solutions, and quizzes.

## Course Description

This course is a senior undergraduate-level course focusing on the basics of numerical methods widely used in engineering practice. The course content will cover topics from **Solving Linear and Nonlinear Equations, Interpolation, Least squares,  Differentiation and Integration, ODE (both IVP & BVP), PDE, Optimization, Fourier Transform, and Eigenvalue & Singular Value**. The homework problems are mainly accomplished by MATLAB coding.

I will gradually upload the related files (codes and my solutions) as many of them are poorly organized in my current view. I may make some modifications and comments as time goes on.
