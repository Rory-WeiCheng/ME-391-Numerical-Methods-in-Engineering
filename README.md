# ME-391 Numerical Methods in Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains the course material of **ME-391 Numerical Methods in Engineering** (formerly called **MATLAB and its applications in Engineering**), 2021 Spring @ SJTU, taught by [Prof Ye Ding](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/dingye.html). The contents include lecture slides, assignments, solutions, and quizzes.

## Course Description

This course is a senior undergraduate-level course focusing on the basics of numerical methods widely used in engineering practice. The course content will cover topics from **Solving Linear and Nonlinear Equations, Interpolation, Least squares,  Differentiation and Integration, ODE (both IVP & BVP), PDE, Optimization, Fourier Transform, and Eigenvalue & Singular Value**. The homework assignments are mainly accomplished by MATLAB coding.

## Textbooks

Numerical Analysis - 2nd Edition by Timothy Sauer

Numerical Analysis - 7th Edition by Richard Burden and J. Douglas Faires

Numerical Computing with MATLAB by Cleve Moler

## Format

Each lecture (chapter) will correspond to a file folder. Each file folder usually contains three subfolders.

**<u>Slides</u>**:

 The lecture slides.

**<u>Quizzes</u>**: 

The quizzes held at the beginning of each lecture, usually last for 5-10 minutes, act as a review and test for understanding the course content.

**<u>Assignments</u>**: 

The homework assignment for the XXth lecture, including 

**problem description** (file name: "MATLAB第XX次作业")

**my solution texts** (file name: "Matlab第XX次作业\_518020910178\_黄韦程")

**src** (my source code. i.e., m file for each problem)

**Figs** (Figures plotted and used)

**assignment feedbacks** (file name: "MATLAB第XX次课后作业反馈")

**standard/reference solutions** (file name: "第XX次课后作业优秀作业参考")



***<u>Notes:</u>** 

Apart from the lecture slides, most materials are in Chinese. I may translate some of the code comments into English in the future for better understanding. If you find my solutions or codes wrong or need to be improved, welcome to leave a message, and I will appreciate it a lot!

## *Other Statement

*The copyrights of all the lecture slides are owed by Prof Ye Ding.

*The copyrights of all the assignments, quizzes, and solutions (including feedbacks) are owed by Prof Ye Ding and the course TA Weijia Zhang and Yongxue Chen.

I will gradually upload the related files (codes and my solutions) as time goes on. It may take quite a long time since many of my past files are poorly organized in my current view, and I may make some modifications and comments before uploading.
